In this topic, you’ll learn more about taking the requirements from your organization and creating a data flow map through your application to define your solution, using the Team Data Science Process.                                       | Locate a resource on “[The 5 data science questions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/studio/data-science-for-beginners-the-5-questions-data-science-answers)” and describe one question your organization might have in these areas. Which algorithms should you focus on for that question?                                                                                                                                            |
| Use Azure Machine Learning Services to create a predictive solution                       | [Azure Machine Learning Services](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/preview/overview-what-is-azure-ml)                         | Microsoft Azure Machine Learning includes working with data sources, using AI for data wrangling and feature engineering, creating experiments, and tracking model runs. All of this works in a single environment and most functions can run locally or in Azure. You can use the Cognitive Network Toolkit (CNTK), TensorFlow, and other frameworks to create your experiments. In this topic, we’ll focus on a complete example of this process, using everything you’ve learned so far.                                                                                                                                                   | [Complete this tutorial on Azure Machine Learning Services and the TDSP.](https://github.com/MicrosoftDocs/azure-docs/blob/master/articles/machine-learning/preview/scenario-tdsp-classifying-us-incomes.md)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |
